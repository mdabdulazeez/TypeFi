# üõ°Ô∏è Security Guidelines for TypeFi

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### ‚ùå What Was Wrong
The faucet private key was **hardcoded directly in the source code**, making it publicly accessible to anyone who could see the repository. This is a **critical security vulnerability**.

### ‚úÖ What We Fixed
1. **Removed hardcoded private key** from source code
2. **Added environment variable** configuration
3. **Added validation** to ensure proper setup
4. **Created security documentation** and warnings

## üö® Security Best Practices

### Private Key Management

#### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Use environment variables** for all private keys
- **Use testnet-only wallets** for development
- **Limit funds** in faucet wallets (only what's needed)
- **Rotate keys regularly** if compromised
- **Use hardware wallets** for production/mainnet
- **Store backups securely** offline

#### ‚ùå DON'T:
- **Never hardcode private keys** in source code
- **Never commit .env files** with real keys
- **Never share private keys** via chat/email
- **Never use mainnet keys** for development
- **Never store keys in plain text** files
- **Never reuse keys** across projects

### Environment Variables Setup

#### For Development:
```bash
# Create your local environment file
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local

# Add your keys (NEVER commit this file!)
echo "FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_actual_private_key" >> frontend/.env.local
```

#### For Production Deployment:
- **Vercel**: Add environment variables in dashboard
- **Netlify**: Set environment variables in site settings
- **AWS/GCP**: Use secrets management services
- **Docker**: Use Docker secrets or mounted volumes

### Git History Cleanup

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The exposed private key is still in Git history. For maximum security:

```bash
# Option 1: Create a new repository (recommended)
# 1. Create new repo on GitHub
# 2. Copy code without .git folder
# 3. Initialize fresh git history

# Option 2: Remove from history (advanced)
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'sed -i "s/6e8a898b02f478a157c8dcd23834b3f11d22f57130437f2b4a8e42ce8168b844/REMOVED_PRIVATE_KEY/g" frontend/app/api/faucet/route.ts 2>/dev/null || true' --all
```

## üîí Current Security Status

### Fixed Issues:
- ‚úÖ Private key moved to environment variables
- ‚úÖ Added validation for missing keys
- ‚úÖ Created security documentation
- ‚úÖ Updated .gitignore to prevent future issues
- ‚úÖ Added environment variable template

### Remaining Actions:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Move funds** from exposed wallet to new wallet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Generate new private key** for faucet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Update environment variables** with new key
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Consider Git history cleanup** (optional)

## üéØ Faucet Security

### Current Implementation:
```typescript
// Secure implementation with environment variables
const FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY;

// Validation to prevent runtime errors
if (!FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'Faucet service unavailable' 
  }, { status: 503 });
}
```

### Additional Security Measures:
- **Rate limiting** by recipient balance
- **Maximum amount** per transaction
- **Input validation** for addresses
- **Error handling** without exposing details
- **Logging** for monitoring (without sensitive data)

## üöÄ Deployment Security

### Environment Variables Needed:
```env
# Public variables (safe to expose)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOMNIA_RPC=https://dream-rpc.somnia.network/

# Private variables (keep secret!)
FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY=xxx
```

### Deployment Checklist:
- [ ] Environment variables configured in deployment platform
- [ ] Private keys NOT in source code
- [ ] .env files NOT committed
- [ ] Faucet wallet has limited funds
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for all endpoints

## üìû Security Incident Response

If you suspect a security issue:

1. **Immediately move funds** from compromised wallets
2. **Generate new private keys** for all services
3. **Update environment variables** everywhere
4. **Review Git history** for other exposed secrets
5. **Monitor transactions** for unusual activity
6. **Document the incident** and lessons learned

## ü§ù Contributing Security

When contributing to TypeFi:

- **Review code** for hardcoded secrets
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
- **Test security measures** before submitting PRs
- **Report security issues** privately first
- **Follow secure coding practices**

**Remember**: Security is everyone's responsibility. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and ask for review.
